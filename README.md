### About Me

👋 Hi there! I'm **Freedom/Oblisk87**, but you can call me Jeffry.

💻 I'm primarily focused on **FiveM game development**, bringing immersive and exciting experiences to the GTA V community.

🎨 In addition to FiveM, I'm also exploring **3D modeling** and **web design**. My 3D modeling journey is still in its early stages, so it's very much a learning project for me.

🚀 I'm part of the **NextGen Development Team**, where we specialize in crafting unique and innovative FiveM content.
